abstract: "Amazon VPC Lattice is designed to simplify service-to-service connectivity at scale across accounts and VPCs with built-in layer 7 routing and policy . Similarly, AWS PrivateLink is designed to make it easier to connect services and resources across different AWS accounts and VPCs to simplify your network architectures. Recently we added capabilities to PrivateLink and VPC Lattice to simplify access to non-HTTP services helps further by eliminating the need of deploying network load balancers in the target VPCs. We will explore which use cases can be addressed with this feature and discuss how these can be implemented with either PrivateLink or VPC Lattice."
