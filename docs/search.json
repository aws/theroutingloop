We’ll whiteboard, chat, and demo the feature to show how it enables centralized controls against data exfiltration and malware injection, with simple setup in explicit mode. Network Firewall Proxy helps you efficiently secure web and inter-network traffic by protecting against domain name and SNI spoofing, enforcing fine-grained access controls, and restricting application traffic to trusted domains or IPs while blocking unintended external responses. You can also enable TLS inspection and apply granular filtering on HTTP header attributes. Comprehensive logging to Amazon S3 and CloudWatch provides deep visibility for monitoring, analysis, and audit. Join us to explore how these new capabilities can strengthen your security posture and simplify traffic governance across your applications."
