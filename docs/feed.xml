    <b>Abstract:</b><br />In this foundational session, youâ€™ll go from zero to dangerous with Amazon VPC Lattice by learning how to register services and resources, associate them with service networks, and expose them through service network endpoints. We'll cover the core building blocks, different consumption patterns, and how to enforce fine-grained access policies across services. By the end, you'll have a solid grasp of when and how to use each component to simplify service-to-service communication across your AWS environment.

  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b><br />Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a widely used technique for authenticating and encrypting communication between clients and servers on AWS. This mechanism is valuable for securing both internet-bound and in-VPC traffic. In this chalk talk, learn how to use mTLS across various AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancer, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon VPC Lattice. Explore use cases, benefits, and implementation strategies to secure APIs with reliable authentication and protect sensitive data during transit with encryption. Learn how to utilize mTLS to enhance the security posture of your AWS applications.
