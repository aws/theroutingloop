    <b>Abstract:</b><br />A new capability of Route 53 Resolver endpoints, that helps customers make delegations for private hosted zone subdomains using Route 53 inbound and outbound Resolver endpoints. The feature allows customers to delegate the authority for a subdomain from their on-premises infrastructure to the Route 53 Resolver cloud service and vice versa, enabling a simplified cloud experience across namespaces in AWS and on their own local infrastructure.

    <b>Abstract:</b><br />Join us for a deep dive into the transformative potential of generative AI in building and managing AWS networks. This webinar will explore how tools like Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q can streamline complex network tasks, from initial greenfield deployments to network migration and modernization. We'll demonstrate practical use cases, including using natural language prompts to deploy a global network with AWS Cloud WAN, updating policies, and generating infrastructure as code (IaC) templates. Learn how to accelerate your network operations, identify vulnerabilities in network diagrams, and estimate costs with the power of AI, all while keeping security and human oversight at the forefront. This session is a must-attend for network architects and cloud teams looking to leverage AI to enhance their productivity and reshape the future of network management.

    <b>Abstract:</b><br />In this episode weâ€™ll dive into Amazon CloudWatch Network Flow Monitor, introduced at re:Invent 2024, and show how you can use it today to gain deep visibility into your VPC network traffic. Through a live demo, weâ€™ll explore how to configure flow monitoring, build insightful dashboards, and uncover dependencies across your environment. Weâ€™ll also highlight how you can use these flow insights to troubleshoot connectivity, detect anomalies, and strengthen security controls. If youâ€™re looking for practical ways to improve network observability and simplify operations on AWS, this session is for you.

    <b>Abstract:</b><br />In this episode of The Routing Loop, weâ€™re diving into network monitoring and observability, and how they differ in the cloud compared to traditional on-prem environments. Cloud networks generate logs and telemetry in ways that require a different approach, and we have a powerful suite of tools to help you make sense of it all.Weâ€™ll explore monitoring solutions purpose-built for the cloud and share strategies for working with the variety of logging data available. Youâ€™ll learn how to leverage these insights to better understand your networkâ€™s health, plan for growth, and troubleshoot issues more effectively.
